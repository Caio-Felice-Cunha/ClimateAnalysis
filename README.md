## Improvements compared to the 1st version
* Database creation in MySQL;
* MySQL connection;
* More graphics;
* Analyzes

## Business Problem
> For this project, MySQL was used as the database for storage. Data was collected from [Berkeley Earth]https://berkeleyearth.org/data/
For this project there was no specific company to be analyzed. <br>
However, temperature analysis can be used for agriculture, civil construction models, livestock, etc. <br>
The main problem in focus is the high temperature variation, as well as its increase as the years go by.
