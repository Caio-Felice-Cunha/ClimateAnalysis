* Analyzes

### Improvements compared to the 2nd version
* Power Bi Dashboard (Report)

## Business Problem
> For this project, MySQL was used as the database for storage. Data was collected from [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/).

For this project there was no specific company to be analyzed. <br>
However, temperature analysis can be used for agriculture, civil construction models, livestock, etc. <br>
The main problem in focus is the high temperature variation, as well as its increase as the years go by.

## Business Assumptions
For this project, we assume that climate predictability is a necessary factor for the development of activities. <br>
We also assume that the rise in temperature can cause changes in the way companies see their business.

## Solution Strategy
To bring a solution to a business problem, a comparison was made with the last years in relation to previous years so that there is a sense of how temperatures can change over time. <br>
For this we use the following tools: <br>
* MySQL
* RStudio

## Data Insights
Temperatures have risen steadily over the last few years and the trend is for it to continue to rise.

## Business Results
For businesses that depend on predictability in temperature, the last few years have brought this, that is, the variability in temperature has become smaller as the years pass. <br>
However, those who need lower temperatures to survive will need to move to regions where the cold is more constant or establish cooling through technology.

## Conclusions
It follows that based on the data provided, US temperatures will increase in the near future. Even though the heat apparently increases a little each year, when we stack up the difference from past times, this change in temperature will affect us all.

## Next Steps
Improve US statistical and regional analysis
